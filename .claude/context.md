 Compact summary
  ⎿ This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
    Analysis:
    Chronologically analyzing the conversation:

    1. **Initial Context**: The conversation started with a previous context about superninja builds removal. The user then
    wanted to remove all references to superninja from the mosmess project and design a CMake prerequisites system for building
    compilers/libraries before project().

    2. **Prerequisites System Design Phase**:
       - User requested removal of superninja references from the project
       - User wanted discussion about prerequisites concept, asking about ExternalProject familiarity
       - Multiple rounds of documentation writing and refinement for prerequisites system
       - Key user feedback included preference for prose over bullet points, double dashes (--) over single dashes in prose, and
     corrections about LOG_* options being booleans not filenames
       - User emphasized file dependency tracking as an alternative to stamps
       - User corrected misunderstandings about step execution order (subsequent steps, not previous)

    3. **Documentation Rewrite Phase**:
       - Created prerequisites-new.md with improved organization and tone
       - Multiple rounds of refinement based on user feedback
       - Transferred function documentation from old to new file
       - User asked specific questions about unclear documentation elements
       - Key clarification: prerequisites require explicit commands, they don't assume CMake

    4. **Documentation Organization Phase**:
       - Rewrote CLAUDE.md with better structure
       - Migrated architecture and build philosophy sections from README.md to design.md
       - Deleted old prerequisites.md and renamed prerequisites-new.md to prerequisites.md

    5. **Implementation Phase**:
       - Created Prerequisite.cmake with complete documentation and stub implementations
       - Discussed test-driven development approach
       - Created comprehensive test plan in tests-prerequisite.md (later moved to doc/)
       - Discussed test framework decisions: CTest, process isolation, CMake script mocks
       - Created todo.md to capture current status and next steps

    Key technical decisions made:
    - Prerequisites system uses dual execution model (configure-time and build-time)
    - Steps execute in order with subsequent steps running automatically
    - Two dependency tracking methods: stamps (default) and file dependencies (optional)
    - Each step uses EITHER stamps OR file dependencies, never both
    - Directory layout follows ExternalProject exactly
    - DEPENDS doesn't work at configure time, only for build targets
    - Variable substitution system for commands using @PREREQUISITE_*@ syntax

    Errors and corrections:
    - Initially misunderstood LOG_* as taking filenames - corrected to boolean values
    - Misunderstood step execution order - corrected to subsequent steps, not previous
    - Initially thought file dependencies modified stamp behavior - corrected to complete replacement
    - Initially gave prerequisites CMake knowledge - corrected to require explicit commands

    Summary:
    1. Primary Request and Intent:
       - Remove all references to superninja builds from the mosmess project, considering the concept fundamentally flawed
       - Design and document a CMake prerequisites system that can build compilers and libraries before project() executes
       - Create documentation that explains concepts clearly to programmers with ordinary skill
       - Ensure the prerequisites system follows ExternalProject patterns where applicable
       - Rewrite CLAUDE.md to preserve relevant information for future development
       - Transfer function documentation from old prerequisites.md to new file and identify unclear/incorrect elements
       - Create Prerequisite.cmake with documentation and stub implementations
       - Develop a comprehensive test strategy for the prerequisites system

    2. Key Technical Concepts:
       - CMake prerequisites system for toolchain bootstrapping
       - Dual execution model (immediate via execute_process() and deferred via build targets)
       - Step-based architecture (download → update → configure → build → install → test)
       - Dependency tracking methods: stamp files vs file-based dependencies
       - Variable substitution in commands (@PREREQUISITE_SOURCE_DIR@, etc.)
       - ExternalProject compatibility for directory layout and behavior
       - Configure-time vs build-time dependency resolution
       - CMake's file() command for glob-based dependency tracking
       - CTest infrastructure for testing with process isolation

    3. Files and Code Sections:
       - /home/jbyrd/git/mosmess/dist/cmake/Superninja.cmake
          - File was removed as part of superninja cleanup
          - Part of the abandoned superninja build concept

       - /home/jbyrd/git/mosmess/README.md
          - Updated to remove superninja references
          - Changed "Ninja files for superninja integration" to "Ninja files"
          - Removed superninja directory structure references
          - Migrated architectural philosophy and build philosophy sections to design.md
          - Added links to documentation files

       - /home/jbyrd/git/mosmess/doc/CLAUDE.md
          - Major rewrite to remove superninja concepts
          - Added comprehensive section on prerequisites system
          - Updated to reflect current architectural decisions
          ```markdown
          ### Prerequisites System for Toolchain Bootstrapping

          A critical component of mosmess is the CMake prerequisites system, which solves the fundamental problem of building
    compilers and libraries before CMake's project() command can detect them.
          ```

       - /home/jbyrd/git/mosmess/doc/prerequisites.md
          - Original prerequisites documentation with detailed function references
          - Deleted after content migration to prerequisites-new.md

       - /home/jbyrd/git/mosmess/doc/prerequisites-new.md (renamed to prerequisites.md)
          - New prerequisites documentation with improved organization
          - Conversational tone, prose-based explanations
          - Complete function reference transferred from old file
          ```cmake
          Prerequisite_Add(my_project
            GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/example/project.git
            GIT_TAG main

            # Configure step depends on CMake files
            CONFIGURE_DEPENDS GLOB CMakeLists.txt cmake/*.cmake

            # Build step depends on source files recursively
            BUILD_DEPENDS GLOB_RECURSE
              @PREREQUISITE_SOURCE_DIR@/*.cpp
              @PREREQUISITE_SOURCE_DIR@/*.h
          )
          ```

       - /home/jbyrd/git/mosmess/doc/design.md
          - Created to hold architectural philosophy and build philosophy sections from README.md
          - Contains detailed explanations of dist/ directory approach and platform composition

       - /home/jbyrd/git/mosmess/dist/cmake/Prerequisite.cmake
          - Created with complete function documentation in CMake RST format
          - Stub implementations for all five prerequisite functions
          ```cmake
          function(Prerequisite_Add name)
            message(STATUS "Prerequisite_Add(${name}) - stub implementation")
            # TODO: Implement prerequisite creation and dual execution model
          endfunction()
          ```

       - /home/jbyrd/git/mosmess/doc/tests-prerequisite.md
          - Comprehensive test plan for prerequisites system
          - Framework decisions and rationale
          ```markdown
          **Why process isolation is critical:** The dual execution model means prerequisites behave completely differently when
     called before vs after `project()`. Before `project()`, they execute immediately and block configuration. After
    `project()`, they only create build targets.
          ```

       - /home/jbyrd/git/mosmess/doc/todo.md
          - Current status and next steps for development
          - Immediate tasks for prerequisites implementation

    4. Errors and fixes:
       - **LOG_* options misunderstanding**:
         - Initially described them as taking filenames
         - User corrected: they are boolean values
         - Fixed documentation to show `LOG_BUILD <bool>` format

       - **Dependency tracking oversight**:
         - Repeatedly forgot about file-based dependency tracking
         - User reminded multiple times that steps can use either stamps OR file dependencies
         - Updated all relevant sections to include both methods

       - **ExternalProject directory structure**:
         - Initially guessed at directory layout
         - User requested verification from source
         - Researched and corrected to match ExternalProject exactly (e.g., PREFIX defaults to `<name>-prefix`)

       - **Single vs double dashes**:
         - Used single dashes (-) in prose
         - User prefers double dashes (--)
         - Updated all prose to use double dashes

       - **Step execution order confusion**:
         - Initially thought requesting a step ran previous steps
         - User corrected: requesting a step runs that step and all SUBSEQUENT steps
         - Updated documentation to reflect correct behavior

       - **Prerequisites CMake knowledge**:
         - Initially used CMAKE_ARGS thinking prerequisites understood CMake
         - User corrected: prerequisites know nothing about CMake, need explicit commands
         - Fixed examples to use explicit CONFIGURE_COMMAND, BUILD_COMMAND, etc.

       - **Configure command syntax**:
         - Initially didn't specify binary directory in examples
         - Corrected to use `-S @PREREQUISITE_SOURCE_DIR@ -B @PREREQUISITE_BINARY_DIR@`
         - Verified this matches ExternalProject behavior

    5. Problem Solving:
       - Solved the chicken-and-egg problem of building compilers before CMake can detect them
       - Designed dual execution model to support both bootstrapping and incremental builds
       - Created comprehensive documentation balancing technical accuracy with readability
       - Integrated stamp-based and file-based dependency tracking methods
       - Ensured compatibility with ExternalProject patterns for familiarity
       - Clarified that file dependencies completely replace stamp tracking for a step (either/or model)
       - Developed test strategy addressing process isolation needs due to project() timing

    6. All user messages:
       - "Hi Claude, I've been investigating the concept of superninja builds over the last day, and after too much
    investigation it seems that the entire fundamental concept is flawed. I'd like to remove all references to superninja builds
     from this project, and come up with an alternative based on a configure-time CMake recipe which provides ExternalProject
    like behavior instead."
       - "For now, your only to-do is to remove all superninja references from this project."
       - "I am still confused about the exact use of these options. Please be specific."
       - "You sure? We also run external processes. Think this through. Do we need to capture the output of external_process for
     some reason? Think."
       - "Okay. That much is not clear in the documentation you've written about those options. Before anything else, clarify
    normal usage vs what happens when those values are set in the docs."
       - "And that is what ExternalProject provides?"
       - "You know, I hate it when I can't trust you and I have to go read the damned documentation myself, and I find that
    you're lying to me."
       - "What I found is that those values are booleans in the actual documentation, not file names."
       - "Yes dammit. How can we work together if you're constantly making shit up?"
       - "I am so frustrated that I have lost my train of thought."
       - "All right. Now I want to talk to you about the concept of prerequisites. Are you completely familiar with all the
    functions in the CMake ExternalProject_* interface? If not, now would be a great time for you to look them up."
       - "No. Again, all the parameters to *_DEPENDS, are handed directly to the CMake file() function."
       - "the DEPENDS command should be more clearly documented to indicate that it does nothing meaningful at configure time"
       - "What's with all the LOG_* options? What are you trying to do there?"
       - "What do those options do exactly in ExternalProject? Your docs are not clear."
       - "OK, so, discuss with me (do not write up) how this can be implemented"
       - "No. You've got it backwards. Requesting a particular step, runs that step and all steps that come AFTER it."
       - "No. I want you to write all that up inside an .md file in the doc directory"
       - "Not bad, and I can't believe that I of all people am going to say this, but it's just a touch too formal. Lighten up a
     notch."
       - "The section I've highlighted, Dual Execution Model, is again just a bunch of bullet points."
       - "Make sure to describe the purpose of this dependency tracking in the documentation"
       - "In your examples, it's not clear that your CONFIGURE_DEPENDS etc. is part of a Prerequisite_Add call."
       - "We need a clearer description of the choices between stamp tracking of completion of a prerequisite step and full on
    GLOB tracking."
       - "No, that's a random list of bullet points, not text. I want a prose discussion comparing and contrasting the two
    methods."
       - "I question STEP_TARGETS. Why should that exist?"
       - "I'd like there to be the capacity to send in variables such as @PREREQUISITE_BINARY_DIR@"
       - "Check out my tweaks."
       - "Please note my tweaks."
       - "Tweaked again"
       - "Tweaked it, please review."
       - "LGTM. Next up, think about stamp file mechanics"
       - "Does ExternalProject use stamps?"
       - "Is our proposed directory structure consistent?"
       - "I notice that you like single dashes - . I like double dashes -- when interspersed in prose."
       - "That fixed everywhere?"
       - "Note that you can, for each step, decide whether you want stamp or dependency tracking."
       - "Not all steps require stamps, remember."
       - "Added some tweaks."
       - "All that is not so in the case where we are using file based prerequisites for a step."
       - "If PREFIX is not given, what does ExternalProject use as a prefix?"
       - "Change the llvm-mos reference to be myprereq, please."
       - "Okay, step based architecture. Go ahead."
       - "Okay, execution flow."
       - "Yes, give it a shot."
       - "Go ahead."
       - "Now go research ExternalProject and look up exactly the directories it uses."
       - "Yes, go ahead."
       - "Now we are running low on context, and I want to get your brain out before I lose you and get compacted."
       - "CLAUDE.md is disorganized but it will do for now. Now I would like you, please, to get the relevant documentation for
    the Prerequisite functions out of the old prerequisites.md file into prerequisites-new.md. Then, ask me any questions about
    that documentation that you consider unclear or incorrect."
       - "1 and 2, agreed. 3: What example shows that depends behavior? I can't see any such example. 4. Default commands for
    prerequisites should do nothing. The prerequisites are fairly foreign beasts by definition -- we can't just treat them as
    normal cmake projects. 5. I don't like these options; I think they should be gone, actually. 6. If it doesn't, then we have
    to do variable substitution on its behalf in our own code."
       - "No, I think you are good to go; I'll review your changes after."
       - "All right, please delete CLAUDE.md."
       - "Now, put your outline into CLAUDE.md. No section numbers please. No content please, just the outline."
       - "Now, write the project overview section."
       - "Next section, please."
       - "Okay. Please continue."
       - "Please write the final section."
       - "Added a few things as well."
       - "I think README.md is completely out of date. I also think some of the information therein belongs in other .md files."
       - "Migrate out the architecture and build philosophy sections into a design.md document in the doc directory."
       - "All right, any other questions before we go back to rewriting prerequisites-new.md?"
       - "Suggest the key elements of the basic bootstrapping section."
       - "Nope, waaay too much information for this little section. This is not a complete how-to -- it is just explaining a
    common use case, with perhaps a few lines of demonstration."
       - "All right. Keep it mostly prose. You can add one function call to Prerequisite_Add to make your point."
       - "No. Did you not read the documentation for the function? Prerequisite knows nothing about CMake per se."
       - "Now correctly use a variable for the cmake binary."
       - "Is it okay to have the ${} and the @ formulation for referencing variables at once? Is that consistent with the rest
    of CMake or not?"
       - "All right, but add a note of explanation on that point to the example."
       - "I tweaked it to clarify."
       - "Now, propose concepts covered in Iterative developmetn."
       - "No, some of that goes into Mixed dependency tracking. Focus the topics accordingly."
       - "Better. Now write that out mostly as prose."
       - "I tweaked it. Discuss things to write about in mixed dependency tracking"
       - "Since you seemed unclear on the non-stamp model, I edited your writing again."
       - "All right, go ahead with your writing."
       - "That cmake configure command would need to have the binary directory expressed similarly."
       - "All right. Now, you have acess to the old prerequisites.md, and the new prerequisites-new.md. Which elements in the
    old file should continue on to the new version, but are not there? Also, anything in the new file that is not clear? Make
    sure to read them both thoroughly."
       - "1. Is it? If so then we should express that in the documentation. Is that consistent with what ExternalProject does? I
     doubt it. Research this and quote the documentation on it. 2. Please be more specific. 3. Agreed."
       - "Read the source code to ExternalProject if you need to."
       - "Yes, I see your point about file dependencies. Personally, I think that you get either file dependencies or stamp
    tracking but not both. File dependencies is basically stating that you are turning it over to the prerequisite's build
    system to manage on every relevant build. I could be argued away from this, but I think it's the right idea."
       - "Oh, I see your point, and yes. Now what parts of the documentation would need to be updated to clarify this?"
       - "All right, you can clarify these points and I will review."
       - "Okay, this bullet point list is confusing and should be rewritten as clear prose."
       - "Show me all the places in the documentation where you have bullet pointed lists."
       - "Rewrite the highlighted section clearly."
       - "No, it's not perfect. Rewrite it again for clarity. If you need multiple paragraphs, take them."
       - "Better."
       - "What other questions do you have about the existing documentation?"
       - "1. Oh, force targets is not in there? Where would that go? 2. That's fine as is. 3. Ew, please fix that. 4. No, let's
    leave it as is for now. 5. No, that's good enough for now."
       - "I see the force targets section already there, and it looks fine to me -- what do you think is missing?"
       - "I thought I already answered those questions -- what do you think is missing agin?"
       - "Last chance to recover anything from prerequisites.md before I delete it and call prerequisites-new the gold
    standard."
       - "Nope, those deletions are correct. When you are ready, please delete prerequisites.md and rename prerequisites-new.md
    to be prerequisites.md ."
       - "All right, I've created Prerequisite.cmake in dist/cmake. Please fill out this file by copying the relevant
    documentation from prerequisites.md and adding stub do-nothing implementations."
       - "Okay big guy, it's time for test driven development! I'd like you to think about the various scenarios that a complete
     test library for this thing would have to go through. Don't create the tests. Think."
       - "Yep. Now, think about a directory structure under tests/ that can handle these concepts and more."
       - "I don't think that testing explicit external tools like meson etc. should be in scope. External tools themselves
    should be mocked. Do plan however to test variable substitutino if you haven't already. Platform testing is valid. I do not
    think performance testing is in scope at this time, because that will require a huge quantity of files and those would make
    this repository huge. Please revise."
       - "It's a little busy, but it's a start. Now please write up a tests-prerequisite.md file that gives us a plan for a test
     suite for the prerequisites cmake file. (We are about to run out of context, so add in whatever detail you need to
    implement this later.)"
       - "That goes in the doc directory, please."
       - "Okay. Now I would like to talk to you about the process you would like to follow for implementing all these tests.
    It's a huge quantity of tests to be sure, and I want to give you the guidance you need to sketch them out."
       - "I am pretty sure that CMake already does file and directory existence testing. Yes, these should generally run in
    separate processes so there is no leakage from project to project."
       - "Oh that's right, we have CMake's test infrastructure. Should we use that or not?"
       - "Sorry, that is a ton of questions, which I am happy to answer, but please organize them so I can do so."
       - "1. Yes use it. 2, I don't understand the difference here. I assume all these tests would have their own build
    directory. 3. They can be small cmake scripts unless there is a reason they ought not to be. 4. Yes and yes; in some cases
    you will want to validate output files against known good versions, to verify order of execution and the like. 5. You'll
    write a basic test or two, and then follow up with a basic Prerequisite_Add implementation. More questions?"
       - "Okay. Add this information to tests-prerequisite.md so that it will be clear to you in the future."
       - "Sorry, you asked me another question. I don't see a difference between a per-test build directory and 'isolated
    directories', whatever that is."
       - "Does it? It looks very bullet point, but if that is how you think and remember things, then that is fine."
       - "The litmus test is you. Will you understand what you are trying to communicate here?"
       - "The why is the most important part. Record that however will help you remember it the best."
       - "Yeah it's better. I wonder, can you store your conversational state after a compact command?"
       - "Is there a way to view the context that a compact command has created, and serialize it?"
       - "Anything else you want to document before compact?"
       - "How about you put that into an indepedent todo.md file in the doc/ directory instead."
       - "Ok thanks. Ready for compact?"

    7. Pending Tasks:
       - Create basic test framework structure (tests/CMakeLists.txt, basic utils)
       - Write 1-2 simple tests against existing stubs to validate framework
       - Implement minimal Prerequisite_Add() functionality to support initial tests
       - Expand tests and implementation incrementally following the phased approach

    8. Current Work:
       Just completed creating a comprehensive todo.md file in the doc/ directory that captures the current development status
    and immediate next steps for the prerequisites system. This was moved from tests-prerequisite.md to create a dedicated
    status tracking file. The todo.md includes:
       - Current status of prerequisites system (stubs exist, documentation complete)
       - Immediate next steps for test framework setup
       - Key implementation reminders (dual execution model, either/or dependency tracking)
       - Longer term goals for platform/vector systems

    9. Optional Next Step:
       The next logical step would be to begin creating the basic test framework structure as outlined in todo.md:
       - Create tests/CMakeLists.txt with basic CTest setup
       - Create utils/ directory with initial helper scripts
       - Write 1-2 simple tests against the existing stub implementations to validate the test framework approach

       This directly follows from the user's explicit request: "You'll write a basic test or two, and then follow up with a
    basic Prerequisite_Add implementation.".
